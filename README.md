Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my first website portfolio.
This project intended to test my skills and understanding everything
what I learned until this point. English is my second language so I tried to explain
everything in short notes.

I plan to update this project when I complete the CodeInstitute course and add more content and projects to present future recruiters.

Some features are disabled and they will be updated in the future:

 - Contact me form is not active  
 - Project section buttons are disabled
 - cv.pdf file is a lorem Ipsum file

## UX

My goal was to make it simple as possible but still in a modern look.
Grayscale colors and with pastel icons color were for me perfect match.

## Technologies

1.  HTML
2.  CSS
3.  Bootstrap (4.0.0)

## Features

This site uses:
 Bootstrap Navbar - it's a nice effect when the user checks the website
with mobile or tablet screen size. It turns Navbar into a "hamburger".

Progressbar with animated stripes - It's effect to catch an "eye" to skills that I have.


## Testing

This site was tested with multiple browsers and devices.


## Deployment

The website is hosted using GitHub pages which were deployed directly from the master branch. The site that is deployed will automatically update itself when new commits are made to the master branch.
